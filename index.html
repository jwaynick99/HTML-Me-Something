          Gus is my <em>good boy</em>. We've got two other dogs in our
          household, but Gus was my first dog. We've been together since before
          me and my wife were living together. Let me introduce him to you.

          When gus was 2 years old, we were living in an upstairs apartment, and
          Gus took a spill down a flight of stairs. This was when we found Gus
          had hip dysplasia. This had him down and out for a few months, and I,
          <em>unfortunately</em> did not have the money to pay for his
          procedure. We did daily therapy at home, and after awhile Gus's gait
          had improved, and now you wouldn't even know he had an injury.

          As noted above, Gus has two dog siblings, and in the last 2 years he
          now has 2 human siblings. (<em>AKA my children</em>) Gus is great with
          kids and other dogs. He's an old soul and would rather lay around with
          the others than do much else. This makes him our perfect family dog.

          Gus is the best dog in the whole world.
          <b>He is better than your dog</b>. I will not be accepting arguments
          on this matter. Hopefully, he will have many more years with me and my
          family.
